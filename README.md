# TicketSwap front-end assignment

Thank you for doing this assignment! The goal is to build a simple search app using [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/)’s public GraphQL API. We’ve already set up a few things to get you started, so you can focus on the front-end only. If you have any questions you can always [contact us](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com).

## Design and assets

Find the design as Sketch document in `/assets/sketch` as well as PNG images under `/assets/png`. We’ve also included SVG files for icons you might need in `/assets/icons`.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It requires **Node** and **npm** to run. Install both via [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven’t yet.

### Clone or download the repository

Clone or download this repository to your local machine and follow below instructions to get everything up and running.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the required dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

All the source files are located inside `/src`. Any changes to those files will automatically reload the browser. If you want to edit the HTML template you can find it in the `/public` folder.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Generates a production-ready build.

## GraphQL API

You’ll be using Artsy’s public GraphQL API for this assignment.

We set up Apollo Client so you can start fetching data with it. Under https://metaphysics-production.artsy.net you’re able to explore the API and its documentation.

## Handing in the assignment

Once you’re done building the app as per design, you can send us a link in reply to our email.
